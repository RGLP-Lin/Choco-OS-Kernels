  hello (sorry i type without shift) this is a line of kernels i make for my OS called Chocolate OS (or Choco OS for short) but the kernels start at 0.8.X anything before 0.8.X
doesnt realy work as a kernel (0.1 is just broken ngl) but every kernel was still made with the intent of being used in future me
